# Commentboard V.1

I was part of a working group that used MS Forms to collect feedback after training sessions.
The group wanted a way for everyone to see the feedback and discussed various option, none of which did everything the group wanted.
While learning React, I realised I could build an app that solved the problem.

## The Panels

Left panel was for people to leave comments about training sessions.
Centre panel was for people to leave comments about what makes them proud to be LGBTQIA+.
Right panel contains links to all previous training sessions.

## Improvements for V.2

[ ] Create Login panel for authorisation
[ ] Refactor modal forms
[ ] Add search and sort functionality to archive panel
